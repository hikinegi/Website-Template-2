					<h4>APEDA eyes $60 billion agriculture exports with support of new policy</h4>
					<p class="mt-4">With the support of new agriculture export policy which has helped in bridging the gap between Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Agriculture the agri exports from the country are likely to touch export target of US $ 60 billion by the year 2022, said Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) a statutory body under Ministry of Commerce.
                    </p>
					<p class="mt-4">“Achieving an agriculture export target of $60 billion by 2022 does not look ambitious, given the current global market conditions. More so, because India’s export basket largely comprises meat, marine products, and basmati rice whose demand in the world market is on constant increase,” said Tarun Bajaj, GM, APEDA, while speaking at a seminar at an organic products trade fair Biofach India 2019.
“With an integrated approach and better cooperation among the two union ministries for boosting  </p>

					<p>agriculture production and trade increase export of organic food products as well as to double Agri-exports to $60 billion by 2022 from current $38 billion” said Bajaj. APEDA has been promoting the export of various agricultural commodities and provides a platform to showcase India’s quality produce to the global market. “After the announcement of Agri Export Policy (AEP) by the government, all the concerned ministries which includes Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Animal Husbandry, Ministry of Food Processing Industries and other agencies are working in close coordination, they are also focusing on exports.In addition, involving states since they also have an important role in encouraging exports of agriculture products from the region.” Bajaj added.
                    </p><p class="mt-4">The Biofach India jointly organised by APEDA and Nurnberg Messe India was inaugurated by APEDA Chairman Paban Kumar Borthakur on Thursday where about 200 Indian organic food products companies are exhibition their products at the event.
                    </p>

				<div class="col-md-4 about-diam about-diam3">
					
					<p class="mt-4">“India exported organic products worth Rs 5151 Crore (over US $ 757 million) in 2018-19, from Rs 3453 Crore in 2017-18 (US$ 515 million ) registering an increase of about 49 %. The major demands under the organic product category are for flax seeds, sesame and soybean; pulses such as arhar (red gram), chana (pigeon pea); and rice, along with tea and medicinal plants. USA and European Union member-countries were the biggest buyers of organic products . There is a growing demand from Canada, Taiwan and South Korea in recent years, Germany is one of the biggest importers of Indian organic products. Now, many new countries are also taking interest” he said.

        <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday hit out at 'right talking' critics of his government's decisions such as the new citizenship law and scrapping of special status for Jammu and Kashmir, saying they have hatred for people who walk the path of 'doing the right things' and break the status quo.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">Speaking at the ET Global Business Summit, he said the global economy has been going through a difficult phase but the fundamentals of the Indian economy are strong and policies are clear that will aid in reaching the target of nearly doubling the size of the economy to USD 5 trillion.In his strongest attack on critics yet, Modi said the 'right talking' gang advocates for rights of migrants world over but are opposed to India giving citizenship to persecuted minorities of neighbouring&nbsp; nations.</p>

        <p class="mb-0">Terming the negotiations ‘complex', the minister said a big win would be when Indian people can benefit from it and innovation, research and development, and better technologies are the areas that New Delhi is focusing on.</p>
